# pokemon_api_project

#### working with the PokeAPI and requests library in Python to grab stats of different Pokemon to make a 'card deck' (5 Pokemon). I took it a little further and used a
random number generator to grab different Pokemon based on their unique ID # from the API. By doing this I was able to generate two decks of different Pokemon and
wrote another function that would compared attack power between the two decks, telling the user which Pokemon was stronger in that category
